# spotify-artist-viewer
A starter iOS project for the Summer 2015 Apprentice Class!

# Added Features
* Paging - continue scrolling through search results infintely
* Custom TableView Cells - Similar to basic cell layout, but with taller cell heights
* Search by Artist, Track, or Both
* Open in Spotify - on each artist or track, you can open in the spotify app (if you have it)
* Tap images to view larger (tap again to exit)
* Always grabs a non-truncated bio for artists
* Activity indicator - appears on search bar when new requests are being sent

# Notes
* Only searches US results, in long run, it should probably get user's country and find search results based on that.
* Album search not enabled (yet)
* Favorites not enabled (yet)
